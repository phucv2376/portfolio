        Hi! My name is Phuc Vo and most people call me Vo because my first name can be a little silly to pronounce. Currently, I am an undergraduate at the University of Missouri - Kansas City majoring in Computer Science. I am on track graduate in May of 2025. 
        Developing an interest for Computer Science at a young age, I had the opportunities to intern for T-Mobile and Cerner at the age of 17. During these experiences, I developed a specialization in Python, REACT Framework, and JavaScript. I am familiar with concepts such as Software Development Cycle and Agile Development. 
        As a kid, I watched a show called Doraemon, where a robot cat from the 21st century time travels to the past to help a clumsy friend with awesome SCI-FI gadgets that seemed essentially limitless. Professionally speaking, I aspire be apart of and contribute to making the world a better and more inclusive place through technical innovations. Magic is to fiction as science is to nonfiction.

        I had the opportunity to take dual credit college level classes at
        Metropolitan Community College, Kansas City in my junior year of High
        School via T-Mobile's Explorer Prep Program. In addition to this, I was
        selected to participate in Prep-KC's Pathways to Technology program,
        taught on the Cerner Campus. Through this opportunity, I gained
        first-hand experience with professionals in the tech industry and had an
        opportunity to work as a Cerner Scholar for my Junior (2021) and Senior
        year (2022) of High School. Presently, I am an undergraduate at the
        University of Missouri - Kansas City majoring in Computer Science. Where
        I had the opportunity to take various classes to further my studies
        within the tech world.
